    challenge: `As the Frontend Team Lead, one of the challenges I faced was managing my team members, especially during times of deviation from the given instruction(s). Additionally, on a personal level, being in an internship program that overlapped with my examination period, the erratic state of power supply, coupled with my PC's damaged battery, presented serious challenges while working on the project.`,
    gains: `Indeed, after difficulty comes ease. Despite all the hurdles, it later turned out to be something that prepared me for similar obstacles that I may encounter at a later time, because for me to be able to scale through successfully, it simply ignites my spirit of not giving up, which is greatly helpful. Also, teamwork and team management skills improved, as well as coding styles and learning, relearning, and unlearning through interactions with others.`
